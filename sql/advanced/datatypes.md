# üìö DATA TYPES

Data types in SQL define the kind of data that can be stored in a table column.  
Choosing the correct data type ensures data accuracy, optimizes storage, and improves performance.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 INT,
    column2 VARCHAR(255),
    column3 DATE
);
```

- `INT` is used for integers.
- `VARCHAR(n)` is used for variable-length text up to `n` characters.
- `DATE` is used for storing calendar dates.

## Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

- This creates an `employees` table with an integer ID, a string for first name, and a date for hire date.

## Key Points

- Always choose the smallest data type that fits your data to save space.
- Text fields are typically `VARCHAR`, while fixed-length text can be `CHAR`.
- Dates and times should use specific types like `DATE`, `TIME`, or `DATETIME`.

## Additional Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

- This creates a `products` table where `price` allows numbers with up to 10 digits total and 2 after the decimal.
