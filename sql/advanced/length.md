# üìö LENGTH

The `LENGTH` function is used in SQL to return the number of characters (or bytes) in a string.  
It helps analyze string sizes or validate input lengths.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT LENGTH(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

- `LENGTH(column_name)` returns the length of the text in characters (or bytes, depending on the database).

## Example

```sql
SELECT LENGTH(first_name) AS name_length
FROM employees;
```

- This query returns the number of characters in each employee's first name.

## Key Points

- In some databases (like MySQL), `LENGTH` returns **bytes**, while `CHAR_LENGTH` returns **characters**.
- For Unicode strings (e.g., UTF-8), the number of bytes may differ from the number of characters.
- Always check your database documentation if exact character count vs byte count matters.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT LENGTH(description) AS description_length
FROM products;
```

- This query measures the length of each product description.
