# üìö TRIM

The `TRIM` function is used in SQL to remove unwanted spaces (or other characters) from the beginning and end of a string.  
It is helpful for cleaning up messy or inconsistent data.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT TRIM(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

- `TRIM` removes leading and trailing spaces by default.
- Some databases allow you to specify which characters to trim.

## Example

```sql
SELECT TRIM(first_name) AS cleaned_first_name
FROM employees;
```

- This query removes any extra spaces at the start or end of each employee's first name.

## Key Points

- In MySQL and PostgreSQL, you can trim specific characters using `TRIM('x' FROM column_name)`.
- SQL Server uses `LTRIM()` for leading spaces and `RTRIM()` for trailing spaces separately.
- Cleaning data before comparisons or reports can prevent hidden errors.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT TRIM('   Hello World   ') AS trimmed_text;
```

- This query returns `'Hello World'` without the extra spaces.
