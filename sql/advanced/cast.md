# üìö CAST

The `CAST` function is used in SQL to convert a value from one data type to another.  
It is useful when you need to change how data is interpreted or formatted.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT CAST(expression AS target_data_type)
FROM table_name;
```

- `expression` is the value you want to convert.
- `target_data_type` is the data type you want to convert to.

## Example

```sql
SELECT CAST(salary AS CHAR(10)) AS salary_text
FROM employees;
```

- This query converts the `salary` number into text format.

## Key Points

- Common conversions include `INT`, `CHAR`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`, and `FLOAT`.
- If conversion fails (invalid format), an error may occur.
- Some databases support both `CAST()` and `CONVERT()` with slight differences.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT CAST(order_date AS DATE) AS simple_date
FROM orders;
```

- This query casts a datetime value into a plain date format.
