# üìö CONCAT

The `CONCAT` function is used in SQL to join two or more strings into a single string.  
It is commonly used to combine columns or add text into results.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(string1, string2, ...) AS combined_column
FROM table_name;
```

- `CONCAT` joins multiple strings or columns into one.
- The result is returned as a single string.

## Example

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees;
```

- This query combines `first_name` and `last_name` with a space in between to create a `full_name`.

## Key Points

- If any argument is `NULL`, the result will also be `NULL` (unless using `CONCAT_WS()` in some databases).
- Use single quotes `' '` to add spaces, commas, or other separators.
- Some databases also have `CONCAT_WS(separator, string1, string2, ...)` to specify a separator automatically.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(city, ', ', state) AS location
FROM customers;
```

- This query combines `city` and `state` into a single `location` string separated by a comma and space.
