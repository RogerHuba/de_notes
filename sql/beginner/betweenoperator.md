# üìö BETWEEN OPERATOR

The `BETWEEN` operator is used in SQL to filter the result set within a certain range.  
It selects values within a given minimum and maximum boundary.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

- `SELECT` specifies the columns you want.
- `FROM` specifies the table.
- `WHERE` filters rows where the column is within the specified range.

## Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 30;
```

- This query selects all users whose `age` is between 18 and 30, inclusive.

## Key Points

- `BETWEEN` is **inclusive** ‚Äî it includes the boundary values.
- You must use `AND` to specify the lower and upper bounds.
- Works with numbers, text, and dates.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
```

- This query selects all products with a `price` between 100 and 500.
