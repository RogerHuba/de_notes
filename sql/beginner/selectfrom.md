# üìö SELECT FROM

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database.  
The `FROM` clause specifies the table you want to select from.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

- `SELECT` defines which columns to retrieve.
- `FROM` specifies the table containing the data.

## Example

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees;
```

- This query retrieves the first name and last name columns from the employees table.

## Key Points

- You can select one, multiple, or all columns (using `*`).
- Column order in `SELECT` matters for the output.
- Queries can include expressions (e.g., `SELECT salary * 1.1`).

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers;
```

- This query retrieves all columns from the customers table.
