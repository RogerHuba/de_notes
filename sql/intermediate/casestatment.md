# üìö CASE STATEMENT

The `CASE` statement is used in SQL to create conditional logic within a query.  
It allows you to return different values based on different conditions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1,
  CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ELSE result3
  END AS new_column
FROM table_name;
```

- `CASE` checks conditions in order and returns the first matching result.
- If no conditions match, the `ELSE` value is returned.
- `END` closes the `CASE` statement and assigns an alias if needed.

## Example

```sql
SELECT first_name, salary,
  CASE
    WHEN salary > 80000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS salary_level
FROM employees;
```

- This query categorizes employees based on their salary range.

## Key Points

- `CASE` can be used in `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, and `WHERE` clauses.
- The `ELSE` part is optional; if omitted and no condition matches, `NULL` is returned.
- Useful for creating dynamic, readable results without needing multiple queries.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT product_name, price,
  CASE
    WHEN price > 500 THEN 'Expensive'
    WHEN price BETWEEN 100 AND 500 THEN 'Moderate'
    ELSE 'Cheap'
  END AS price_category
FROM products;
```

- This query classifies products into price categories.
