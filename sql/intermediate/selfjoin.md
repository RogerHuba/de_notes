# üìö SELF JOIN

A `SELF JOIN` is a SQL operation where a table is joined with itself.  
It is useful for comparing rows within the same table.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT A.column1, B.column2
FROM table_name A
JOIN table_name B
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```

- You create table aliases (`A`, `B`) to differentiate between the two instances of the same table.
- The `ON` clause specifies how the rows are matched.

## Example

```sql
SELECT A.employee_id, A.first_name, B.manager_id, B.first_name AS manager_name
FROM employees A
JOIN employees B
ON A.manager_id = B.employee_id;
```

- This query lists employees along with the names of their managers.

## Key Points

- A `SELF JOIN` requires table aliases to avoid confusion.
- It behaves like a regular join but matches rows within the same table.
- Useful for hierarchical or relationship-based data (like employees and managers).

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT A.customer_name AS referrer, B.customer_name AS referred
FROM customers A
JOIN customers B
ON A.customer_id = B.referrer_id;
```

- This query shows customers and the customers they referred.
