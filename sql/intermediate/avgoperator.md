# üìö AVG OPERATOR

The `AVG` function is used in SQL to return the average value of a numeric column.  
It is useful for finding the mean value of data, such as average salary or average sales.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `AVG(column_name)` calculates the average of the values in the specified column.
- Can be combined with `GROUP BY` to find averages within different groups.

## Example

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM employees;
```

- This query returns the average salary of all employees.

## Key Points

- Only works with numeric columns.
- Ignores `NULL` values when calculating the average.
- Commonly used with `GROUP BY` to calculate averages per group.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

- This query shows the average salary for each department.
