# üìö FULL OUTER JOIN

The `FULL OUTER JOIN` is used in SQL to return all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.  
If there is no match, `NULL` values are returned for the missing side.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns matching records from both tables.
- If there‚Äôs no match, it still returns the record with `NULL` for missing values.

## Example

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

- This query lists all employees and departments, showing all records even if there is no match.

## Key Points

- Combines the results of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.
- Rows without a match in one of the tables will have `NULL` values for that table's columns.
- Not all database systems (like MySQL) support `FULL OUTER JOIN` natively ‚Äî workarounds like `UNION` may be required.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
FULL OUTER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

- This query lists all customers and orders, even if a customer has no orders or an order has no customer.
