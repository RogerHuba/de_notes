# üìö SUBQUERY WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

A subquery with aggregate functions is used to perform a calculation in a subquery and then use that result in the main query.  
It allows for comparisons against computed values like averages, maximums, or minimums.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name > (SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM another_table WHERE condition);
```

- The subquery uses an aggregate function like `AVG()`, `MAX()`, or `SUM()`.
- The outer query uses the result of the subquery for filtering or comparison.

## Example

```sql
SELECT first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

- This query selects employees who earn more than the average salary.

## Key Points

- Subqueries with aggregates must be enclosed in parentheses `()`.
- The subquery must return a **single value** when used in a comparison.
- Common aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()`.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products);
```

- This query selects the product with the highest price.
