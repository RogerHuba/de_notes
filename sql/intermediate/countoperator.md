# üìö COUNT OPERATOR

The `COUNT` function is used in SQL to return the number of rows that match a specified condition.  
It is often used with `GROUP BY` to count rows within each group.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `SELECT` specifies what you want to retrieve.
- `COUNT(column_name)` returns the number of non-null values in that column.
- `COUNT(*)` counts **all rows**, including rows with `NULL` values.

---

## Example

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count_result
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

- This query counts the number of employees who work in the Sales department.
- count_result is what will be displayed

---

## Key Points

- `COUNT(*)` counts all rows regardless of `NULL` values.
- `COUNT(column_name)` counts only rows where the column is **not NULL**.
- Commonly used with `GROUP BY` for group-level counts.

---

### Handling NULL Values

By default, the COUNT function includes NULL values in its calculation. However, you can exclude NULL values by using the COUNT(column_name) function on a specific column that does not contain NULL values. For example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(salary) AS non_null_salaries 
FROM employees;
```

This query will count the number of non-NULL salary values in the "employees" table.

---

### Counting Distinct Values

To count distinct (unique) values in a column, you can use the COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) syntax. This allows you to obtain unique occurrence counts. For example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS distinct_departments 
FROM employees;
```

This query will count the number of unique departments in the "employees" table.

---

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

- This query shows the number of employees in each department.

---

### üìù Problem Description

Retrieve the department and the count of employees as "EmployeeCount" in each department. Display the results in descending order based on the "EmployeeCount".

---

### DataBase Given

Constraints:
The input table employees contains valid data.

Output Format:
A result set with columns:
department (varchar)
EmployeeCount (int)

Sample Output:

| department | EmployeeCount |
|------------|---------------|
| Sales      | 2             |
| HR         | 2             |
