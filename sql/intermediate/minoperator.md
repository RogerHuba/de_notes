# üìö MIN OPERATOR

The `MIN` function is used in SQL to return the lowest value in a specified column.  
It is useful for finding the smallest number, earliest date, or alphabetically first string.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `MIN(column_name)` returns the minimum value from the specified column.
- Can be combined with `GROUP BY` to find minimum values within groups.

## Example

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary)
FROM employees;
```

- This query returns the lowest salary from the employees table.

## Key Points

- Works with numeric, date, and text columns (for text, it returns the alphabetically first value).
- Ignores `NULL` values.
- Can be used inside a subquery or with `GROUP BY`.

## Additional Example

```sql
SELECT department, MIN(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

- This query shows the lowest salary for each department.
